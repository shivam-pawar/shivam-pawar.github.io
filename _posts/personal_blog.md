Friendship is really a precious thing from God and I'm thankful for the friends that God given me to impact me as I've walked these 16 to 18 years.
When we meet a person who understand you, laugh with you, make life easier, and pray for you, yes for obvious, you found a dear friend.

In college and school, I got friends from different walk of life. I was pleasantly surprised to have so many peoples with different face structure, language and obviously different life goals.

I was in college when I began to understand different layers of friendships and how they come to our life, impact, and go.

We come across too many peoples in our lives. If you are one of those who like to talk with different peoples, like I do, you will probably bound with them pretty much well.

School, college, coaching classes, work place, trip do we expect same type of nature or behaviour from each of these friendship ?

I believe, the introduction of social media like one of them, Facebook, has created a enlarged network of friends and friendship that was never exists in real life. We can be friend with one whom we haven't seen in year, our work place friends, called colleagues, meet only in working days.

We can be proud of having that much enormous friend circle, but are all of the friends are real friends ?

There is difference in the way you look at life from that point on, or a change in the things you're experiencing. Some friendships can handle changes. But sadly, those who are not handle these changes will broken down.

At the last, I would say friendships might be temporary at times, but each friend you meet can add a lasting lesson to your life. Enjoy your friendships for what they are and for however long they remain in your life.
