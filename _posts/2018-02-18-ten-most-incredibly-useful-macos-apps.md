Hi, I'm __Shivam Pawar__ currently studying at Rajarambapu Institute of Technology. I'm also a part of RIT India Linux User's Group abbrivated as __RITINLUG__. I'm always supporting open source software and use them for my daily work on projects as well as for other activities in our college.
There are lots of new students who want to know about open source and our Linux User's Group started a discussion for the same.
The idea behind this discussion session is to help others while sharing your knowledge with them. This is weekly session, and everyone participate in this by their own interest.

## First Discussion :
First session started with my classmates and senior. Many of us are new at __RITINLUG Discussion__. Firstly we discuss the the meaninig of open source and meaning comes out that a software for which the original source code is made freely available which should be redistributed and modified according to the requirement of the user. Open source software is that by which the source code can be modification or enhancement by anyone for reusability and accessibility.

After this discussion we move towards history of Open Source, Open Source Movement is branched from the free software movement which began in the late 80s with the launching of the GNU project by __Richard Stallman__. Stallman is regarded within the open source community as sharing a key role in the conceptualization of freely shared source code for software development.

## IRC
It's a good idea to be always in connect with our seniors and employeed alumni for this purpose our group introduced us about __IRC__ (Internet Relay Chat). I learn how to connect with them, how to messege them and most important thing i.e., how to ask our query to them so that they will help us with appropriate soluation.

Basically, Internet Relay Chat (IRC) is an application layer protocol that facilitates communication in the form of text.
IRC is mainly designed for group communication in discussion forums, called channels, but also allows one-on-one communication via private messages as well as chat and data transfer, including file sharing.
